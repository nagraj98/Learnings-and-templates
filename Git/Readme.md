# Git and Github

## Embedding a video in the readme file :
 1. Convert video into *.gif* format. ( using a tool like [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/gif-converter) )
 2. Upload the *.gif* file to the repository in which you have the readme file.
 3. Navigate to and open the file, and copy the link
 4. In the readme file, add this link like so.
 > `![](https://github.com/.../.../.../myfile.gif)`

Example Gif :
![]()

Points to note about a gif file :
1. A *gif* is **not** a video, it cannot have sound and playback options (play, pause and seek).
2. It is instead a collection of individual images played like a flipbook. 
3. GIF was designed primarily for images and uses LZW (which was defined in 1984), which is not a good compression format for lossless compression
4. Hence its size is generally larger than the original *mp4* video file, and yet worse in quality.
